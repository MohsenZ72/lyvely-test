# Angular User Profile with Tailwind CSS

This is a standalone Angular project using **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The project is component-based and handles user profiles with the ability to follow and unfollow other users.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: The project adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Profile Pages**:
  - `/profile/1`: Your account
  - `/profile/2`, `/profile/3`, ...: Other users' profiles
- **Follow/Unfollow**: You can follow and unfollow users directly from their profile.
- **Search client-side in Followers/Following**: Users can search and filter through their followers and following lists.

- **Image error handling**: The project uses conditional logic to replace broken images with fallback images.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

> **Note**: The layout and features are based on a design, but only the necessary parts have been implemented for this project. The full design is not complete, but the key features are functional.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run in development mode**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the project in development mode, and you can view it in your browser.

   ## Standalone or Modular

   The project is standalone but can be modularized if needed for larger applications. With more time, I could improve the project further. Let me know which approach is better for your needs—I’m passionate about contributing to your team and can be helpful in making this work for your project.
